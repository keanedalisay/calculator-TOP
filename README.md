# Project Calculator

## An in-the-browser calculator! Yeah...

You get to:

* Add numbers (wow!).
* Subtract them (yes!).
* Multiply (:o).
* and Divide (:/).

You can also:

* Clear the input display (:|).
* Delete characters one by one (:|).
* Write decimals (:|). 
* and See the answer before pressing the equal button! (:|)

*As of writing 12/08/2022*, both parentheses do display in the input when pressed but when calculating an equation using it, I made it so to return 'Syntax Error'.

This is because if I do not, it would return 'NaN' (not-a-number) and the whole calculator would broke. I did research on how to write code that could detect parentheses and calculate it, but I have to rewrite the whole function in order for me to do it and I do not want to waste time doing that.

Instead, I want to move on and tackle bigger projects than this... and when I am experienced enough, I could hopefully revisit this project and make the parentheses work as intended.
